ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* Shelves.iml
* Shelves.ipr
* Shelves.iws
* build.properties
* build.xml
* default.properties
* resources/
* resources/.svn/
* resources/.svn/all-wcprops
* resources/.svn/entries
* resources/graphics/
* resources/graphics/.svn/
* resources/graphics/.svn/all-wcprops
* resources/graphics/.svn/entries
* resources/graphics/.svn/prop-base/
* resources/graphics/.svn/prop-base/book-page.psd.svn-base
* resources/graphics/.svn/prop-base/pocket-library.psd.svn-base
* resources/graphics/.svn/text-base/
* resources/graphics/.svn/text-base/book-page.psd.svn-base
* resources/graphics/.svn/text-base/pocket-library-gradients.txt.svn-base
* resources/graphics/.svn/text-base/pocket-library.psd.svn-base
* resources/graphics/book-page.psd
* resources/graphics/pocket-library-gradients.txt
* resources/graphics/pocket-library.psd
* sample-data/
* sample-data/.svn/
* sample-data/.svn/all-wcprops
* sample-data/.svn/entries
* sample-data/.svn/prop-base/
* sample-data/.svn/prop-base/library.txt.svn-base
* sample-data/.svn/text-base/
* sample-data/.svn/text-base/library.txt.svn-base
* sample-data/library.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/org/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/.DS_Store
* src/org/curiouscreature/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/curiouscreature/.DS_Store
* src/org/curiouscreature/android/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/curiouscreature/android/.DS_Store
* src/org/curiouscreature/android/shelves/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/curiouscreature/android/shelves/.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
